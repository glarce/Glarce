# AR Experience in a browser

## Why did we create Glarce AR

Well, it was mainly for a school IT project. We were required to help create an interactive AR tour of our school. This was fine except that they wanted us to use the proprietary software [HP Reveal](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LZ3Ca4goYhV7Uzw5CMx%2Fuploads%2Fsquare%2FMain.svg?alt=media&token=107a7a76-9cc3-42a8-87e3-62e3c3979f27). We ran into some problems with that, the main one being that there was no easy way to play a video \(that I could find\). We also hated that HP Reveal requires you to download an app to use it. That is why we have created this program.

## Development

At the moment there are no stable structures for development, issue templates or pull requests. You can still do all three of those things, but things are a bit of a mess at the moment. The following instructions are for building and developing:

### Install 

```bash
yarn
```

### Dev

Development server with live reload \(if you don't have CORS\)

```text
yarn serve
```

### Build

Build for production

```text
yarn build
```

## Production

As of yet this is still in early development with major changes on the way. Don't expect stable updates to soon...
